# izik8s üêà  
  
izik8s will target users who want to deploy and test some solutions around the k8s world  
on a multi-node cluster that you can self-host with virtual machines. For example you will be  
able to test solutions like [kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench), [popeye](https://github.com/derailed/popeye), [k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) or [haproxy-ingress](https://github.com/haproxytech/kubernetes-ingress) on cluster close to a  
prod-one if you simulate traffic for example with [gatling](https://github.com/gatling/gatling). You will never fear about testing a  
new tool on your company's Kubernetes Development cluster.
